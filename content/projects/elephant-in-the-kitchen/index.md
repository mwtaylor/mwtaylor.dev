title: 'Elephant in the Kitchen'
summary: "My collection of personal recipes. 

          Made with Hugo and served using GitHub pages. Recipes are indexed by the type of recipe, cuisine, and 
          ingredients. Includes a special presentation mode when cooking recipes that displays each step individually
          for easy reading in the kitchen. Uses Bootstrap for a responsive layout on all types of devices."
